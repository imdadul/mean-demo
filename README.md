# Mean-demo FE.

Before ruuning the application make sure that the [backend server](https://github.com/imdadul/mean-demo-BE) is already running.

If yes, now let's start the front-end application.

Open cmd or bash run these commands,

```
git clone https://github.com/imdadul/mean-demo-FE.git 
npm install
npm start
```

http://localhost:8080   .........Gooo!
 

In case you want to change the backend endpoint, goto <code>modules/common/constants/config.js</code> & change <code>BASE_URL</code>
